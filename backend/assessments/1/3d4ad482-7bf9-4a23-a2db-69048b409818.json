      "answer": "It states that the two alleles of a trait separate during gamete formation and only one enters each gamete.\nFor example, in pea plants, tall (T) and dwarf (t) separate so gametes carry either T or t.",
      "chapter": "Heredity and Evolution",
      "question": "How does Mendel\u2019s Law of Segregation explain the inheritance of traits in pea plants?"

      "question_id": "265d56d9-0662-4e25-a8a5-3cce14dd6dda",
      "answer": "An electric motor works on the principle that current-carrying conductors in a magnetic field experience a force.\nThe split-ring commutator reverses the direction of current every half rotation so the coil keeps rotating in the same direction.",
      "chapter": "Magnetic Effects of Current",
      "question": "What happens to the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire if the direction of the current is reversed? Explain using the right-hand thumb rule."
