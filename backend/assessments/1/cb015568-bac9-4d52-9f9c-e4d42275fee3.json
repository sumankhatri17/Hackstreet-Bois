      "answer": "Let \n\ud835\udc5f\nr be rational and \n\ud835\udc56\ni be irrational.\nAssume their sum is rational: \n\ud835\udc5f\n+\n\ud835\udc56\n=\n\ud835\udc5e\nr+i=q.\nThen \n\ud835\udc56\n=\n\ud835\udc5e\n\u2212\n\ud835\udc5f\ni=q\u2212r. Since difference of rationals is rational, \n\ud835\udc56\ni becomes rational, which is a contradiction.\nSo the sum is always irrational.\nExample: \n3\n+\n2\n3+\n2\n\t\u200b\n\n is irrational.",
