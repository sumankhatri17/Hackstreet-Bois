      "answer": "An electric motor works on the principle that current-carrying conductors in a magnetic field experience a force.\nThe split-ring commutator reverses the direction of current every half rotation so the coil keeps rotating in the same direction.",
      "chapter": "Magnetic Effects of Current",
      "question": "How does an electric motor convert electrical energy into mechanical energy? Explain the role of the split ring commutator in this process."
