      "question_id": "5d37b720-9de2-4ff6-a11d-6118088c48aa",
      "answer": "An electric motor works on the principle that current-carrying conductors in a magnetic field experience a force.\nThe split-ring commutator reverses the direction of current every half rotation so the coil keeps rotating in the same direction.",
      "chapter": "Magnetic Effects of Current",
      "question": "What happens to the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire if the direction of the current is reversed? Explain with a diagram."
