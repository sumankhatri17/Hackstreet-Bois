      "answer": "Proof by contradiction:\nAssume \u221a5 is rational. Then \u221a5 can be written as p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors (in lowest terms) and q \u2260 0.\n\u221a5 = p/q\nSquaring both sides:\n5 = p\u00b2/q\u00b2\n5q\u00b2 = p\u00b2\nThis means p\u00b2 is divisible by 5, so p must be divisible by 5 (since 5 is prime).\nLet p = 5m for some integer m.\nSubstituting:\n5q\u00b2 = (5m)\u00b2\n5q\u00b2 = 25m\u00b2\nq\u00b2 = 5m\u00b2\nThis means q\u00b2 is divisible by 5, so q must also be divisible by 5.\nBut if both p and q are divisible by 5, they have a common factor of 5, which contradicts our assumption that p/q is in lowest terms.\nTherefore, our assumption is wrong, and \u221a5 is irrational",
