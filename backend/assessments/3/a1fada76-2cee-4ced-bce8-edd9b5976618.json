      "answer": "Lines: \"The wind whispered through the trees, carrying secrets of the night.\"\nEffects of personification:\nCreates atmosphere: By giving the wind human qualities (whispering, carrying secrets), the poet creates a mysterious, almost eerie mood. It makes nature feel alive and intentional rather than random.\nEmotional connection: Personification makes the abstract (wind) more relatable by giving it human actions. Readers can imagine and feel the gentle, secretive quality of the wind more vividly.\nImplies deeper meaning: The phrase \"carrying secrets of the night\" suggests hidden knowledge or mysteries in nature, adding depth and intrigue to the scene. It transforms a simple weather description into something symbolic and meaningful.\nSensory experience: \"Whispered\" appeals to our sense of hearing and creates a soft, intimate tone, making readers feel as if they're experiencing a private, sacred moment in nature.",
