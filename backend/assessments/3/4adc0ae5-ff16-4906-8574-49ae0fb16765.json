      "answer": "The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14 and measures hydrogen ion concentration. A pH less than 7 indicates acidic substances, pH equal to 7 indicates neutral substances, and pH greater than 7 indicates basic substances. The lower the pH, the more acidic; the higher the pH, the more basic.Example of pH 7 substance: Pure water is neutral with a pH of 7.",

      "answer": "Metals have high melting and boiling points because they have strong metallic bonding. In metallic bonds, atoms release their valence electrons to form a \"sea of electrons\" that holds the metal ions together in a strong lattice structure. This requires significant energy to break.Non-metals typically have low melting and boiling points because they form covalent or molecular compounds with weak intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces) between molecules, which require less energy to overcome.",

      "answer": "Mendeleev's Periodic Table arranged elements in order of increasing atomic mass and grouped elements with similar properties together. He left gaps for undiscovered elements and sometimes placed elements out of atomic mass order to maintain property patterns.\nThe Modern Periodic Table arranges elements in order of increasing atomic number (number of protons) and is based on the periodic law that properties repeat periodically with atomic number. This arrangement resolved the anomalies in Mendeleev's table.",

      "answer": "Respiration is essential because it releases energy from food (glucose) in the form of ATP, which powers all cellular activities necessary for life, growth, repair, and movement.\nDifference from breathing: Breathing is the physical process of inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide. Respiration is the biochemical process occurring in cells where glucose is broken down with oxygen to release energy (cellular respiration: C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082 \u2192 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + Energy).",

      "answer": "The hypothalamus serves as a crucial link between the nervous and endocrine systems.\nNervous system role: It regulates body temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep, and emotional responses by controlling the autonomic nervous system.\nEndocrine system role: It produces releasing and inhibiting hormones that control the pituitary gland, which in turn regulates other endocrine glands. It also produces hormones like ADH (antidiuretic hormone) and oxytocin.",

      "answer": "The Law of Segregation states that each parent carries two copies (alleles) of each gene, and these alleles separate during gamete formation, with each gamete receiving only one allele. During fertilization, offspring receive one allele from each parent.\nIn pea plants, Mendel showed this with traits like height. A tall plant (TT) crossed with a short plant (tt) produces all tall offspring (Tt) in the F1 generation. When F1 plants self-pollinate, the alleles segregate, producing a 3:1 ratio of tall to short plants in the F2 generation (TT, Tt, Tt, tt).",

      "answer": "When light passes from air (less dense) into water (denser), it bends toward the normal (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface). This bending is called refraction.\nThe refractive index of water (approximately 1.33) is higher than air (approximately 1.0), meaning light travels slower in water. The amount of bending depends on the angle of incidence and is governed by Snell's law: n\u2081 sin \u03b8\u2081 = n\u2082 sin \u03b8\u2082.",

      "answer": "The ciliary muscles control the shape of the eye lens to focus on objects at different distances.\nFor near objects: Ciliary muscles contract, releasing tension on suspensory ligaments. The elastic lens becomes thicker and more curved, increasing its converging power to focus near objects on the retina.\nFor distant objects: Ciliary muscles relax, tightening the suspensory ligaments. The lens is pulled thinner and flatter, decreasing its converging power to focus distant objects on the retina.",
