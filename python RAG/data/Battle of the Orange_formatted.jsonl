Include its brief history, people involved, major activities, religious or social importance, duration, and drawbacks, if any.\nTeej: A Festival of Love and Devotion\n\nTeej is a Hindu festival celebrated in Nepal, particularly by women. The festival is usually celebrated in the month of August or September, and it lasts for three days.\n\nThe history of Teej can be traced back to the Hindu mythology, where the festival celebrates the reunion of Lord Shiva and his consort Parvati. According to the legend, Parvati observed a strict fast and prayed to Lord Shiva for a husband. After years of penance, Lord Shiva accepted Parvati as his wife, and the day of their reunion is celebrated as Teej.\n\nThe celebrations of Teej in Nepal involve women fasting for the longevity of their husbands, and unmarried women fasting for a good husband. The major activities during the festival include singing, dancing, and feasting on traditional delicacies. Women dress up in red and green attire, and they adorn themselves with jewellery. The festival is also marked by the swinging of swings decorated with flowers.\n\nTeej has both religious and social significance in Nepal. The festival promotes the bond between husband and wife, and it celebrates the strength of a woman's love and devotion. It is also a time for women to come together and celebrate their sisterhood. Teej is a time for reflection and introspection, and it encourages women to be strong and courageous in the face of adversity.\n\nHowever, the festival is not without its drawbacks. Strict fasting during Teej can be physically demanding, and it can have adverse effects on women's health. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness about the need to celebrate Teej in a safe and healthy manner, by following the traditional practices while also taking care of one's health.\n\nIn conclusion, the festival of Teej in Nepal is a celebration of love, devotion, and sisterhood. The festival has a rich history, involves women of all ages, and has both religious and social significance. While there are drawbacks associated with the festival, the community has started taking steps to celebrate it in a safe and healthy manner.", "left_items": [{"label": "a", "text": "Kritika asked me, \"why did you go out last night?\""}, {"label": "b", "text": "\"Who was that beautiful woman, Usha?\" said Sunita."}, {"label": "c", "text": "\"How is your mother?\" said Gaurab to Yang Dolma."}, {"label": "d", "text": "My friend wanted to know, \"What are you going to do at the weekend?\""}, {"label": "e", "text": "\"Where will you live after graduation?\" said my teacher."}, {"label": "f", "text": "Anusha said to Melisha,\"What were you doing when I saw you?\""}, {"label": "g", "text": "I said to the piligrim, \"How was the journey?\""}, {"label": "h", "text": "\"How often do you go to cinema?\" said Krishana."}, {"label": "i", "text": "\"Do you live in Patan?\" said the Principal."}, {"label": "j", "text": "Niraj said to Luniva,\"Did Phadindra arrive on time?\""}], "right_items": [{"label": "c", "text": "\"How is your mother?\" said Gaurab to Yang Dolma."}, {"label": "d", "text": "My friend wanted to know, \"What are you going to do at the weekend?\""}, {"label": "i", "text": "\"Do you live in Patan?\" said the Principal."}], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.446198Z"}}
