While the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are numerous, including improved safety and sustainability, there are still significant challenges to be overcome, such as operating safely in complex human environments, public perception, and regulatory issues. The next two years will be focused on addressing these challenges, including testing at facilities such as the Mcity Test Facility at the University of Michigan. Ultimately, the vision is for completely driverless vehicles that can be used anywhere in the world.\n\nReading Text: How Driverless Cars will Change Our World\nIt's late at night in the Metro area of Phoenix, Arizona. Under the artificial glare of street lamps, a car can be seen slowly approaching. Active sensors on the vehicle radiate a low hum. A green and blue 'W' glows from the windscreen, giving off just enough light to see inside – to a completely empty driver seat.\n\nThe wheel navigates the curb steadily, parking as an arrival notification pings on the phone of the person waiting for it. When they open the door to climb inside, a voice greets them over the vehicle's sound system. \"Good evening, this car is all yours – with no one upfront,\" it says.\n\nThis is a Waymo One robotaxi, hailed just 10 minutes ago using an app. The open use of this service to the public, slowly expanding across the US, is one of the many developments signalling that driverless technology is truly becoming a part of our lives.\n\nThe promise of driverless technology has long been enticing. It has the potential to transform our experience of commuting and long journeys, take people out of high-risk working environments and streamline our industries. It's key to helping us build the cities of the future, where our reliance and relationship with cars are redefined – lowering carbon emissions and paving the way for more sustainable ways of living. And it could make our travel safer. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. \"We want safer roads and less fatalities. Automation ultimately could provide that,\" says Camilla Fowler, head of automated transport for the UK's Transport Research Laboratory (TRL).\n\nBut in order for driverless technology to become mainstream, much still needs to change. \"Driverless vehicles should be a very calm and serene way of getting from A to B. But not every human driver around it will be behaving in that way,\" says David Hynd, chief scientist for safety and investigations at TRL.\n\n\"It's got to be able to cope with human drivers speeding, for instance, or breaking the rules of the road.\" And that's not the only challenge. There's regulation, rethinking the highway code, public perception, improving the infrastructure of our streets, towns, cities, and the big question of ultimate liability for road accidents. \"The whole insurance industry is looking into how they're going to deal with that change from a person being responsible and in charge to the vehicle doing that,\" says Richard Jinks, vice president of commercial at Oxfordshire-based driverless vehicle software company Oxbotica, which has been testing its technology in cars and delivery vehicles at several locations across the UK and Europe.\n\nThe ultimate vision experts are working towards is of completely driverless vehicles, both within industry, wider transport networks, and personal-use cars, that can be deployed and used anywhere and everywhere around the world.\n\nBut with all these hurdles in place, what exactly does the next 10 years have in store for autonomous vehicles?\n\nTwo years from now\nThe biggest hurdle for those in the driverless technology industry is how to get the cars to operate safely and effectively in complex and unpredictable human environments. Cracking this part of the puzzle will be the major focus of the next two years.\n\nAt the Mcity Test Facility at the University of Michigan, experts are addressing this. The world's first purpose-built testing ground for autonomous vehicles, it's a mini-town of sorts, made up of 16 acres of road and traffic infrastructure. It includes traffic signals and signs, underpasses, building facades, tree cover, home and garage exteriors for testing delivery and ride-hailing, and different terrains such as road, pedestrian walkways, railway tracks, and road markings which the vehicles must navigate. It's here that experts test scenarios that even the most experienced of drivers may be pressed to handle, from children playing in the street to two cars trying to merge on a junction at the same time.\n\nGlossary from the Text\nMetro /ˈmɛtroʊ/ - A rapid transit system, also known as a subway or underground, used for transportation in urban areas.\n\nArtificial /ɑrˈtɪfɪʃl/ - Made or produced by human skill or labor rather than by natural processes; not genuine or natural.\n\nGlare /ɡlɛr/ - A harsh, bright, dazzling light, often caused by reflection.\n\nRadiate /ˈreɪdiˌeɪt/ - Emit energy, light, or heat in the form of rays or waves; to spread out from a central point.\n\nWindscreen /ˈwɪndˌskrin/ - A transparent screen located at the front of a vehicle, designed to protect passengers from wind and debris.\n\nDriver seat /ˈdraɪvər sit/ - The seat in a vehicle where the person who is driving sits.\n\nNavigates /ˈnævəɡeɪts/ - To plan and direct the course of a vehicle or vessel.\n\nArrival notification /əˈraɪvəl ˌnoʊtəfɪˈkeɪʃən/ - A message or alert notifying someone that a person or vehicle has arrived at a destination.\n\nRobotaxi /ˈroʊbəʊtæksi/ - A type of autonomous vehicle that is designed to operate as a taxi or ride-hailing service without a human driver.\n\nHailed /heɪld/ - To signal or call out to a vehicle, especially a taxi or ride-hailing service, in order to request a ride.\n\nEnticing /ɪnˈtaɪsɪŋ/ - Attractive or tempting; likely to lure or attract someone.\n\nTransform /trænsˈfɔrm/ - To change the form, appearance, or nature of something.\n\nCommuting /kəˈmjuːtɪŋ/ - The act of traveling to and from work or school on a regular basis.\n\nHigh-risk /haɪ rɪsk/ - Associated with a greater than average risk or danger.\n\nStreamline /ˈstriːmˌlaɪn/ - To make more efficient or organized by simplifying or eliminating unnecessary steps or processes.\n\nIndustries /ˈɪndəstriːz/ - A category of business activity, typically involving the manufacture or production of goods or services.\n\nReliance /rɪˈlaɪəns/ - Dependence on or trust in something or someone.\n\nRedefined /riːdɪˈfaɪnd/ - To redefine something means to give it a new and different meaning or interpretation.\n\nEmissions /ɪˈmɪʃənz/ - The production and discharge of something, especially gases or radiation.\n\nSustainable /səˈsteɪnəbl/ - Capable of being maintained or continued without depleting natural resources or causing significant environmental damage.\n\nSafer /ˈseɪfər/ - Free from harm, danger, or risk.\n\nWorld Health Organization /wɜrld hɛlθ ˌɔrgənəˈzeɪʃən/ - An international organization that works to promote public health around the world.\n\nEstimates /ˈɛstəmeɪts/ - A rough calculation or approximation of the value, amount, or extent of something.\n\nFatalities /fəˈtælətiz/ - Deaths caused by accidents\n\nExercise of How Driverless Cars Will Change Our World [Class-10]", "left_items": [], "right_items": [], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.494097Z"}}
