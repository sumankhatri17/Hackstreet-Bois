What is the speed of the water particles compared with?\n\nThe speed of the water particles is compared with the height of a group of adult humans.\n\nb. How are bubbles formed in the boiling water?\n\nBubbles are formed in boiling water when water molecules have enough energy to push back other water molecules in the liquid phase.\n\nc. Mention two things on which external pressure depends.\n\nExternal pressure depends on the depth of water and the density of water.\n\nd. How is the atmosphere related to the pressure of water?\n\nThe atmosphere is related to the pressure of water as it contributes to the total pressure on the surface of the liquid. The atmosphere pushes down on the surface of the liquid, which increases the pressure in the liquid. So, the pressure of water is affected by both the atmospheric pressure and the pressure exerted by the water itself.\n\ne. What would happen if the atmospheric pressure on the liquid water was decreased?\n\nIf the atmospheric pressure on the liquid water was decreased, it would also decrease the pressure in the liquid. If the pressure is reduced enough to bring it down to the same level as the vapor pressure, the water particles will have enough energy to form boiling bubbles without needing to increase the temperature.\n\nf. What would the experimenter gain if s/he pulled the plunger out?\n\nIf the experimenter pulls the plunger out, it would decrease the pressure in the liquid and induce boiling.", "left_items": [{"label": "a", "text": "What is the speed of the water particles compared with?"}, {"label": "b", "text": "How are bubbles formed in the boiling water?"}, {"label": "c", "text": "Mention two things on which external pressure depends."}, {"label": "d", "text": "How is the atmosphere related to the pressure of water?"}, {"label": "e", "text": "What would happen if the atmospheric pressure on the liquid water was decreased?"}, {"label": "f", "text": "What would the experimenter gain if s/he pulled the plunger out?"}], "right_items": [{"label": "c", "text": "Answer these questions."}, {"label": "c", "text": "Mention two things on which external pressure depends."}, {"label": "d", "text": "How is the atmosphere related to the pressure of water?"}], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.657133Z"}}
