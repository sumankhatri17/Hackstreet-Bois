Use the following guidelines in your article.\nInternet and Cyber Security\n\nBy Ranju Rana\n\nMarch 7\n\nIn the modern era, the internet and technology have become an integral part of our daily lives. With the rise of digitalization, we rely on the internet for communication, shopping, banking, entertainment, and more. However, along with its benefits, the internet has also brought a number of security concerns.\n\nThe internet is a vast network that is prone to abuse. Cybercriminals and hackers use various tactics to gain access to personal information, steal identities, and disrupt systems. These abuses can have a significant impact on individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.\n\nIt is essential to prioritize data privacy and take measures to safeguard our digital lives. Data privacy refers to the protection of personal information and ensuring that it is not accessed, used, or shared without authorization. This can be achieved through various means, such as using strong passwords, installing antivirus software, and being mindful of the information that is shared online.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial to be aware of the various tactics used by cybercriminals and hackers, such as phishing, malware, and social engineering. Phishing involves the use of fraudulent emails or websites to trick individuals into sharing sensitive information, while malware refers to malicious software that can infect systems and steal data. Social engineering involves the manipulation of individuals to gain access to sensitive information.\n\nIn conclusion, the internet has revolutionized the way we live our lives, but it also brings with it a host of security concerns. We must take measures to protect our personal information and be aware of the tactics used by cybercriminals and hackers. By prioritizing data privacy, we can safeguard our digital lives and ensure that the internet remains a safe and secure place for everyone.", "left_items": [{"label": "a", "text": "Mrs. Paudel went to ...the...school to meet her son's teacher."}, {"label": "b", "text": "What time did you get .....X..... home yesterday?"}, {"label": "c", "text": "....The....Netherlands consists of twelve provinces."}, {"label": "d", "text": ".....X...Everest is the pride of our country."}, {"label": "e", "text": "...The...Nile is the longest river in Africa."}, {"label": "f", "text": "...X....New Road is a financial hub in Kathmandu."}, {"label": "g", "text": "....X..Aarohan Gurukul Theater was founded in 1982."}, {"label": "h", "text": "What did you have for ..X...breakfast this morning?"}, {"label": "i", "text": "Braille system was developed to help ....the.. blind for reading and writing,"}, {"label": "j", "text": "Do you always play...X.....badminton at school?"}], "right_items": [{"label": "c", "text": "Fill in the blanks with the correct articles.
