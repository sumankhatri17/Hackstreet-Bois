The poem is written in free verse, which allows Whitman to capture the natural rhythms and sounds of the rain.\n\nThe poem begins with the speaker describing the sound of the rain, which he likens to a \"delicate pattern\" that gradually grows louder until it becomes a \"mighty torrent.\" He then describes the way the rain \"sings\" as it falls, creating a \"mellow, liquid, murmur\" that fills the air.\n\nAs the poem continues, the speaker explores the many different forms that rain can take. He describes the way rain falls on different surfaces, such as the roofs of buildings or the leaves of trees, and how it creates different sounds and patterns depending on where it lands.\n\nThe speaker also reflects on the effect that rain has on the natural world. He notes how it brings life and vitality to plants and animals, and how it cleanses and purifies the air and the earth. He even suggests that the rain has a spiritual power, saying that it \"has a soul\" and that it speaks to the speaker in a language that he can understand.\n\nThroughout the poem, Whitman celebrates the beauty and power of the rain, and encourages his readers to listen to its voice and appreciate its many gifts. Ultimately, \"Voice of the Rain\" is a meditation on the natural world and our place within it, reminding us of the profound connection between humanity and the environment.", "left_items": [], "right_items": [], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.635441Z"}}

When the poet asks about the identity of the drizzle, she replies that she is the poem of the Earth. The rain expresses that it gives happiness to Mother Earth.\n\nThe rain is a perpetual process which has different forms at different times. It rises from the land as water vapour and ascends high up to the sky. It takes the form of clouds. Though it changes its form or shape, its originality remains unchanged. It shows that nature is not fully understood. Some parts of it always remain mysterious.\n\nThe raindrops pour down from above to wash away atomizes and dust layers. It quenches the thirst of the dry Earth and heals everything that is becoming lifeless. In other words, the showers make the Earth pure and beautiful.\n\nFinally, the poet observes that the life of rain is similar to that of a song. A song also has the power to calm, heal, transform and thrill. In the same way, repeated evaporation and condensation purifies the rain.

Write a letter of complaint to the concerned authority about the unmanaged garbage in your locality. Mention the hazards of unmanaged garbage to public health and suggest some measures to solve the problem.\n[Address]\n\n[Datee]\n\nThe Mayor,\n\nLalitpur Metropolitan\n\nLalitpur, Nepal\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to bring to your attention the unmanaged garbage problem in our locality that has been a persistent issue for several months. The piles of garbage on the streets and in open areas are causing a lot of inconvenience and health hazards for the residents.\n\nUnmanaged garbage is not only an eyesore but also poses a severe threat to public health. The garbage attracts rodents and insects, which can spread diseases like dengue, malaria, and plague. The foul odor emanating from the garbage is causing respiratory problems and nausea among the residents.\n\nMoreover, the garbage blocks the drainage system, which leads to waterlogging during the rainy season. This, in turn, causes a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other disease-carrying pests.\n\nTherefore, I urge the concerned authority to immediately solve this problem. Some measures that can be taken to manage garbage effectively are:\n\nRegular garbage collection: The garbage should be collected from households and commercial areas on a regular basis.\n\nSegregation of waste: The residents should be encouraged to segregate the waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories.\n\nRecycling: The non-biodegradable waste should be recycled to reduce the amount of garbage that ends up in landfills.\n\nPublic awareness: The residents should be educated on the hazards of unmanaged garbage and the importance of proper waste disposal.\n\nI hope that the concerned authority will take prompt action to manage the garbage in our locality, which will not only improve the living conditions but also promote public health.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRamji Acharya", "left_items": [], "right_items": [], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.635678Z"}}
