We appreciate this important focus on bringing young leaders into decision-making and planning processes related to climate action. We also welcome the emphasis you place on receiving and giving frank and fearless advice, and the urgency of holding government and corporate leaders to account on climate action.\n\nWe are disappointed, however, that you have not expanded this list of young climate leaders to children in all their diversity. Millions of children took part in school strikes for climate action in 2019 and early 2020 and demonstrated their outrage and constructive solutions in equal measure. They have been agents of change in the climate debate using their channels of influence-schools, social media, and street protest-to catalyse global activism on the climate crisis. We have seen children from the global North to the global South engaging with political and corporate leaders- in their home countries and also within the international system-most recently at the UN Human Rights Council-claiming their right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment as critical foundation to realizing their wellbeing and rights.\n\nIt was, after all, a child. Greta Thunberg, who sparked this global movement through an inspiriting solo protest in 2018. By 2019, she was able to rightly assert: \"We proved that it does not matter what you do and that no one is too small to make a difference.\" In 2020, children are saying the same thing. Like Fabrizio, a 16 year old boy from Peru, who told us on a recent child-led online conversation, \"The Future of Children is at stake now, tomorrow will be too late.\" Children like Fabrizio are vocal in their anxiety that our dash to economic recovery will scupper climate change at net-zero commitments. They continue to pressure on us all for urgency, and to fight for a green recovery.\n\nOnce again, Secretary-General, we congratulate you on the establishment of the Youth Advisory Group on climate change. We ask, however, that it be inclusive of children and adolescents younger than 18; respecting their right to be heard and to contribute their expertise directly. We also ask that as preparations for COP26 advance, you call for the UK and Italy to give children a safe space to influence these upcoming preparatory events. We would of course be happy to support a process that facilitates meaningful engagement with children across the globe on both your Group and COP26.\n\nIf the last two years have taught us anything it is that children, armed with information and a sense of purpose, have a unique role to play by participating in decision-making processes and in combating crises with constructive solutions. Let us make sure that we learn and apply this lesson to the planning process related to climate action.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nSave the Children\n\nChild Rights Connect\n\nGlossary from the Text\naccelerating /əkˈsɛləreɪtɪŋ/ - making something happen more quickly\n\naccount /əˈkaʊnt/ - a report or description of an event or experience\n\nactivism /ˈæktɪvɪzəm/ - the policy or action of using vigorous campaigning to bring about political or social change\n\nadolescent /ˌædəˈlɛsənt/ - a young person in the process of developing from a child into an adult\n\nagent /ˈeɪdʒənt/ - a person or thing that takes an active role or produces a particular effect\n\nanxiety /æŋˈzaɪəti/ - a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome\n\nassert /əˈsɜrt/ - state a fact or belief confidently and forcefully\n\ncatalyze /ˈkatəlʌɪz/ - cause or accelerate (a reaction) by acting as a catalyst\n\nclimate /ˈklaɪmət/ - the weather conditions prevailing in an area in general or over a long period\n\ncommitment /kəˈmɪtmənt/ - the state or quality of being dedicated to a cause, activity, etc.\n\ncorporate /ˈkɔːpərət/ - of or relating to a large company or group\n\ndecision-making /dɪˈsɪʒnˌmeɪkɪŋ/ - the process of making choices, especially important ones\n\ndemonstrate /ˈdɛmənstreɪt/ - show or prove something clearly and convincingly\n\ndiversity /daɪˈvɜːsɪti/ - a range of different things\n\neconomic /ˌiːkəˈnɒmɪk/ - relating to economics or the economy\n\nemphasis /ˈɛmfəsɪs/ - special importance or significance given to something\n\nengage /ɪnˈɡeɪdʒ/ - participate or become involved in\n\nestablishment /ɪˈstæblɪʃmənt/ - the action of establishing something\n\nexpertise /ˌɛkspɜːˈtiːz/ - expert skill or knowledge in a particular field\n\nfrank /fræŋk/ - open, honest, and direct in speech or writing\n\nglobal /ˈɡləʊbl/ - relating to the whole world; worldwide\n\ngovernment /ˈɡʌvənmənt/ - the group of people with the authority to govern a country or state; a particular ministry in office\n\nholding /ˈhəʊldɪŋ/ - keeping in one's possession; retaining\n\ninclusive /ɪnˈkluːsɪv/ - including all the services or items normally expected or required\n\ninfluence /ˈɪnflʊəns/ - the capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or behavior of someone or something\n\ninspiriting /ɪnˈspɪrɪtɪŋ/ - uplifting or encouraging\n\nExercise of Open Letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres", "left_items": [], "right_items": [], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.525634Z"}}

Children are often the most vulnerable members of our community, and their needs and concerns must be taken into account while making decisions that affect them. I believe that this would not only help in creating a more inclusive decision-making process but also foster a sense of responsibility and ownership among the children.\n\nAs we all know, climate change is a growing concern globally, and children are among the most affected by its consequences. Therefore, it is imperative that we listen to their voices and take steps to mitigate their effects. By involving them in the decision-making process, we will be able to come up with more effective solutions to the problems that we are facing.\n\nI would be grateful if you could consider my request and take the necessary steps to involve representatives of children in decision-making processes related to children's issues in our municipality/rural municipality.\n\nThis would be a positive step towards creating a more inclusive and sustainable community.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRamji Acharya\n\nExtra Bit\nSkimming: Skimming is a technique used to quickly read through a text to get a general idea of the content.
