Nepali Times recently caught up with Shah to talk about his journey. Born in Siraha, Shah had a humble upbringing and started working at a hotel in Ahmedabad at the age of 10. There he began washing dishes and was eventually given a shot at cooking by the executive chef. After several years of hard work and learning, he became an executive chef himself. His journey eventually led him to the UK, where he now works as a chef. Shah believes that two things describe his journey: he always asks what is next and he is a risk-taker. He is very happy with where he is but never stops learning and keeps trying to do better. He takes satisfaction in knowing that he has come a long way because he took risks. Participating in MasterChef has given him a platform to introduce Nepali food to the world, and he is excited about this opportunity.\n\nText Source", "left_items": [], "right_items": [], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.679457Z"}}

Complete the text below with the correct form of the verb given in the brackets.\nWhy is Neelam smiling? It sounds like an easy question: she (is having) a good time with friends and she (feels )good after a good shot. But psychologists often argue about this question. Some believe that smiling is an individual act: we smile because we feel happy unless we (try ) to hide our emotions. Others claim that we smile to build social relationships. Some animals use a grin to show that they (will not) fight, for example. Perhaps our smile serves the same function. So, who's right? In one study, researchers filmed people bowling. If you watch people doing a very social activity like this, it looks as if they always (smile). They stop smiling only when they (concentrate) on their next shot. But when do they start smiling again? After each good shot, the researchers took photographs to identify when the smile starts — while the player( is still looking) down the alley or a few seconds later when they turn round to share their happiness with the group.\n\nWriting II\nNowadays, many Nepali prefer fast foods like noodles, pizza, burgers, etc. to typical Nepali foods. This has an adverse effect on their health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this claim? Write a couple of paragraphs giving reasons to support your view.\n\nAdverse Effects of Fast Food Consumption on Nepalese People\nIt is true that fast food has become increasingly popular in Nepal, especially among the younger generation. While it may be convenient and tasty, the consumption of fast food on a regular basis can have adverse effects on one's health. Fast foods are typically high in calories, saturated fats, sodium, and sugar, which can lead to obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other health problems.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional Nepali foods such as rice, curry, lentil soup, bread, and beaten rice can provide a balanced and nutritious diet. These foods are usually made from fresh ingredients and contain a variety of nutrients that are essential for a healthy lifestyle. For instance, lentils, rice, and vegetables are good sources of proteins, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, and fibre.\n\nIn conclusion, while fast food may be a convenient and enjoyable option, it is important to balance its consumption with traditional Nepali foods that provide essential nutrients. A healthy diet and lifestyle can prevent various health problems and improve overall well-being.", "left_items": [], "right_items": [{"label": "c", "text": "Complete the text below with the correct form of the verb given in the brackets."}], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.679676Z"}}
