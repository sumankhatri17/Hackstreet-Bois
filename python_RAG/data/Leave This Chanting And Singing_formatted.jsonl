{"id": "leave_this_chanting_and_singing_intro_1", "file": "Leave This Chanting And Singing", "section_label": "intro", "type": "unknown", "text": "Leave This Chanting And Singing\n\"Leave This Singing and Dancing\" is a poem written by the renowned Bengali poet and polymath Rabindranath Tagore. The poem was included in the syllabus for grade 10 students in many educational systems. It was first published in Tagore's collection of poems titled \"Gitanjali,\" which earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. The poem delves into the theme of spiritual awakening and urges the reader to look beyond the materialistic pleasures of life and embrace the ultimate truth. With its simple yet profound language, \"Leave This Singing and Dancing\" continues to inspire readers across generations.\n\nSummary of the poem Leave this singing and Dancing\n\"Leave This Chanting and Singing\" is a poem written by Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali polymath who was one of the most important cultural figures of modern India. The poem urges the reader to abandon superficial expressions of faith and instead seek a deeper, more authentic connection with the divine.\n\nThe first stanza of the poem sets the tone by calling out the \"chanting and singing\" of religious rituals as being empty and meaningless if they are not accompanied by a sincere devotion to the divine. The speaker urges the reader to abandon these superficial expressions and instead focus on finding the true source of spiritual fulfilment.\n\nIn the second stanza, the poem turns to nature as a source of inspiration and guidance. The speaker suggests that the natural world can offer a glimpse of the divine, and encourages the reader to seek out this connection by immersing themselves in the beauty of the world around them.\n\nThe third stanza is perhaps the most enigmatic, as the speaker seems to suggest that the divine is present within each individual, but can only be accessed through a deep understanding of oneself. The lines \"Know thyself, and therein lies the truth\" suggest that self-knowledge is the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n\nOverall, \"Leave This Chanting and Singing\" is a poem that encourages the reader to seek a deeper, more authentic connection with the divine by abandoning superficial expressions of faith and instead focusing on self-knowledge and an appreciation of the natural world. It is a powerful call to look beyond the surface and find meaning in the depths of one's own being.\n\nReading Comprehension\nVocabulary\nChanting - repetitive singing or speaking of religious or spiritual words or phrases\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is urging the listener to stop their religious rituals and focus on doing good deeds instead.\n\nTiller - a person who tills or prepares land for planting\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is telling the listener that God is not just in a temple, but also in the fields where the tiller is working hard.\n\nPath-maker - a person who makes or clears paths or roads\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is saying that God is also present where the path-maker is working to make the path easier for people.\n\nGarment - a piece of clothing\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is suggesting that God is present in the fields, covered in dust just like a person's clothes would be after working hard.\n\nMantle - a loose sleeveless cloak or shawl\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is telling the listener to shed their holy mantle or clothing, and get down to work like the tiller and the path-maker.\n\nMeditations - deep thoughts, often in a religious or spiritual context\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is urging the listener to stop focusing solely on their own meditation and prayer, and instead focus on doing good deeds for others.\n\nIncense - a substance that is burned to produce a fragrant scent\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is telling the listener to leave aside their offerings of incense, and instead go out and do good deeds for others.\n\nTattered - torn, ragged, or worn out\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is suggesting that the listener need not worry about their clothes becoming tattered or stained while doing good deeds for others.\n\nToil - hard work, especially physical labor\n\nContextual meaning: The speaker is telling the listener to stand by God, even during hard work and toil, and to sweat in doing good deeds for others.\n\nLiterary Devices Used in the Poem\nImagery: The poet uses vivid sensory details to create images in the reader's mind.

Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!\"\n\nExercise", "left_items": [], "right_items": [], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.509008Z"}}
