Draft a short speech entitled, ‘Importance of Exercise for Healthy Life’.\nDear audience,\n\nIt is my pleasure to speak to you today about the importance of exercise for a healthy life. We all know that exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy body, but the benefits of regular physical activity go far beyond just physical health.\n\nRegular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Exercise also helps to strengthen our immune system, improve our mood, and reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nIn addition to the physical benefits, exercise can also improve cognitive function, memory, and overall brain health. It can also help to improve sleep quality and reduce the risk of depression and other mental health conditions.\n\nIt's important to remember that exercise doesn't have to be intense or time-consuming. Even a moderate amount of physical activity, such as brisk walking, can provide significant health benefits.\n\nSo, let us all make a commitment to incorporate regular exercise into our daily routines. Whether it's a morning walk, a yoga class, or a gym session, let us prioritize our health and wellbeing by making exercise a part of our lives.\n\nThank you.\n\nGrammar II", "left_items": [], "right_items": [], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.357614Z"}}

Draft a speech on obesity based on the given guiding questions.\nWhat are the primary causes of obesity?\n\nWhat are its consequences?\n\nWhat should an individual do to avoid it?\n\nGood morning/afternoon, everyone.\n\nToday, I would like to talk about a matter of great concern that has been growing over the past few years - obesity.\n\nObesity is a condition where a person has an excess amount of body fat, and it has become increasingly common across the globe. In fact, according to recent studies, obesity rates have tripled in the last 50 years.\n\nSo, what are the primary causes of obesity? Well, there are a number of factors that contribute to it. One of the most significant is our modern lifestyle, which is largely sedentary. People are spending more time sitting in front of their computers or televisions and less time engaging in physical activities. Another cause of obesity is poor dietary choices. Consuming foods that are high in calories, sugar, and fat can lead to weight gain and obesity. Genetics, certain medical conditions, and medications can also be contributing factors.\n\nThe consequences of obesity can be severe and far-reaching. Health problems associated with obesity include heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Furthermore, obese individuals may experience discrimination and face difficulties in their personal and professional lives.\n\nTo avoid obesity, individuals can take steps to change their lifestyle and dietary habits. One important step is to engage in regular physical activity, such as taking walks, going to the gym, or participating in sports. Alongside exercise, maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet is essential. A diet high in fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can provide the necessary nutrients without excessive calories. Portion control is also important, as overeating can lead to weight gain.\n\nIn conclusion, obesity is a growing concern that should not be ignored. By making lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and making healthier dietary choices, individuals can take steps to avoid obesity and its associated health risks. Let's work together to promote healthy living and fight against obesity.\n\nThank you.", "left_items": [{"label": "a", "text": "The hermit said, “Don’t idle away your time.”"}, {"label": "b", "text": "Maan said to his friend, “Please help me with money.”"}, {"label": "c", "text": "“Be not afraid, noble prince”, said the Guru."}, {"label": "d", "text": "He said to me, “Let me do my work.”"}, {"label": "e", "text": "The General said to his troops, “Guard the fort.”"}, {"label": "f", "text": "Aaswin said to the teacher, “Please excuse me, madam.”"}, {"label": "g", "text": "The guide said to the visitors, “Follow me carefully.”"}, {"label": "h", "text": "My teacher said to me, “Don’t look behind.”"}, {"label": "i", "text": "Mother said to the daughter, “Get ready to receive the guests.”"}, {"label": "j", "text": "The boy said to the daughter, “Get ready to receive the guests.”"}, {"label": "k", "text": "The teacher said to the boys, “Read silently.”"}, {"label": "l", "text": "The coach said, “Let’s play a friendly football match.”"}, {"label": "m", "text": "The monk said to us, “Give up bad habits.”"}, {"label": "n", "text": "Father said to me, “Do not tell a lie.”"}], "right_items": [{"label": "c", "text": "Report the following sentences in direct speech."}, {"label": "c", "text": "“Be not afraid, noble prince”, said the Guru."}, {"label": "d", "text": "He said to me, “Let me do my work.”"}, {"label": "i", "text": "Mother said to the daughter, “Get ready to receive the guests.”"}, {"label": "l", "text": "The coach said, “Let’s play a friendly football match.”"}, {"label": "m", "text": "The monk said to us, “Give up bad habits.”"}], "mappings": [], "meta": {"source": "user_upload", "generated_at": "2025-12-24T13:48:39.357695Z"}}
